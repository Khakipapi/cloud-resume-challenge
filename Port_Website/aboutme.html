            <p>
                I am a dedicated Cloud Engineer with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and a distinguished background as an Army war veteran and squad leader. My military experience has instilled in me a robust discipline and exceptional leadership skills. I bring these qualities to cloud engineering and DevOps, where I leverage cutting-edge technologies and methodologies to develop scalable, efficient cloud infrastructures and streamline deployment processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in languages like JavaScript and Python, and expertise in systems such as AWS and Linux, I am adept at designing solutions that enhance operational capabilities and drive technological innovation. My passion for cloud engineering is driven by a commitment to optimizing cloud solutions and improving system performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I enjoy practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and foster a mindset of continuous improvement. They not only keep me physically fit but also enhance my problem-solving abilities and mental resilience, qualities that are invaluable in the fast-paced world of technology.
